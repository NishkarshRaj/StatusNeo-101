# Polynomial Linear Regression in Python

**Note:** Independent variables must be **Matrix** in python with size (a,b) and Dependent variables must be a **vector** with size (a,).

## Part 1: Data Pre-processing

**Note:** Whenever our dataset consists of small number of values, it is a good practise to train on the entire data set rather than splitting the data set because:
1. There is not enough information to train the machine and thus the testing might give incorrect results
2. To improve accuracy of our model, it is better to maximize the training data set.
